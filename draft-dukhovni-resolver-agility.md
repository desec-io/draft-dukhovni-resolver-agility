.# Abstract

DNSSEC (RFC 4035) allows a zone to be signed with multiple signature
algorithms.
RFC 4035 specified only signer requirements for zones signed with multiple
algorithms, this document clarifies the corresponding requirements for
validating resolvers.
When the DS record set for a zone securely indicates that the zone is signed
using at least one algorithm supported by a validating resolver, the resolver
MUST avoid downgrade attacks by ensuring that authoritative RRsets from such a
zone are accompanied by at least one supported valid signature.

This document updates RFCs 4035 and 6840 with relaxed DNSKEY and RRSIG inclusion
requirements for signers, and more explicit requirements for validators.

# Introduction

DNSSEC (with core specifications [@!RFC4033], [@!RFC4034], [@!RFC4035],
[@!RFC6840]) employs a number of zone signing algorithms, some already obsolete,
some mainstream and mandatory to implement, and others recommended to implement,
but not yet widely deployed.
Validating resolvers generally support a range of algorithms beyond the
mandatory-to-implement set: some that are deprecated, but still deployed by a
non-negligible number of live zones, and others that are expected to be in wider
use in the future.
The status of the various algorithms is noted in Section 3 of [@!RFC8624], which
is expected be updated in subsequent documents from time to time.

Some zones may be signed with multiple algorithms.  Such multi-algorithm zones
are typically in a transitional state from one algorithm to another, with at
least the new algorithm expected to be (or become) widely deployed, allowing the
older algorithm to be dropped at the end of the transition period.
(For the rollover procedure, see [@?RFC6781] Section 4.1.4.)

Algorithms that a zone is signed with are signaled via the delegation's DS
record set which is signed and published by the parent.
For each algorithm signaled this way, RRSIG signatures are expected to be
present for each record in the zone (see Section 5.11 of [@!RFC6840]).

Therefore, for a multi-algorithm zone, a resolver is expected to treat all the
mutually supported signature algorithms as equally valid, and to accept valid
signatures made via any of the supported algorithms (see Section 5.4 of
[@!RFC6840]).
This mechanism is not expected to ensure that the strongest of multiple shared
algorithms is the only one used for validation; the sole requirement is
resistance to downgrades to "Insecure" for zones signed via a supported
algorithm.

A given validating resolver may not support one or more of the algorithms a zone
is signed with.
When none are supported, absent local policy requiring the zone to be signed,
the resolver MUST consider the zone "Insecure" (see Section 4.3 of [@!RFC4035]).
But whenever the zone's signature algorithms
overlap with those supported by the resolver, the zone MUST NOT be treated as
"Insecure"; this holds even when no DNSKEYs or RRSIGs for supported algorithms are included
in a given reply.
(#requirements) below explains these requirements in greater detail.

{#requirements}
# Requirements on Signature Algorithms Present in DNSSEC Zones and Answers

To include a child domain in the parent's DNSSEC chain of trust, the parent
provides a cryptographic link to the child.
The parent does this by publishing cryptographic hashes of the DNSSEC keys that
the child wishes to be included in the delegation.
As various hash digest algorithms are available, the one used for a given hash is
recorded alongside each fingerprint.
This information, together with the key's signing algorithm (and some derived
"keytag" metadata), is included in the parent zone in the form of "Delegation
Signer" (DS) records, alongside the delegation's NS (and glue) records.

Due to the degree of freedom in choosing the hash algorithm, the parent may
publish several DS records for the same key (one per hash algorithm).
Typically, one or two DS records are published for a given key ([@!RFC8624]
Section 3.3).

A domain's delegation thus has at least one DS record for each child DNSSEC key
that the child has designated to be included in the delegation.
The DS record's hash digest algorithm and the associated key's signing algorithm
can easily be seen by inspection of the DS record data.

Note that the hash digest algorithm used for DS record preparation is not to be
confused with the signing algorithm of the DNSSEC key associated with that DS
record.


{#signer}
## Signer Requirements

The zone's candidate signing keys are those zone apex DNSKEYs with the protocol field set to 3 ([@!RFC4034] Section 2.1.2) and the "Zone Key" flag bit set ([@!RFC4034] Section 2.1.1).
Keys that do not fulfill these conditions are not signing keys and cannot be used for validation.
(Note that the "Secure Entry Point" bit is informational only and not examined during validation, see [@!RFC4034] Section 2.1.1.)

Previous RFCs mandated that a DNSKEY be included in the zone for each algorithm present in the delegation's DS RRset and expected trust anchors for the zone, and that each RRset in the zone be signed with each algorithm (though not necessarily each key) present in the DNSKEY RRset ([@!RFC4035] Section 2.2 and [@!RFC6840] Section 5.11).

These requirements are ignorant of the fact that some signing algorithms are expected to be universally supported by validators, namely those that are defined as mandatory-to-implement (MTI), as evident from the value "MUST" in column "DNSSEC Validation" of the table in [@!RFC8624] Section 3.1 (and its successors).

Operational experience has shown that a more differentiated approach taking into account the destinction of MTI and non-MTI algorithms is desirable.
The above requirements are therefore updated as follows.

{#dnskey}
### Inclusion of DNSKEY Records

The zone signer MUST ensure that

  - if the delegation's DS RRset is non-empty, the zone includes at least one DNSKEY for an MTI signing algorithm, and that this DNSKEY is referenced in the DS RRset; and that
  - if the delegation's DS RRset includes any non-MTI signing algorithms, a DNSKEY is included for each of these algorithms; and that
  - if trust anchors are published for the zone, a DNSKEY is included for at least one MTI algorithm that is present in the trust anchor set.

It is understood that any DNSKEYs included due to the aforementioned requirement are proper candidate signing keys and referenced by the delegation's DS RRset and/or trust anchors, respectively.

### Inclusion of RRSIG Records

For each signing algorithm that does appear in the DS RRset or a trust anchor, the zone signer MUST ensure that

  - there exists at least one DNSKEY which signs the zone apex DNSKEY RRset and is referenced by the DS RRset and/or trust anchor, respectively; and that
  - each RRset in the zone is signed by some DNSKEY of that algorithm.

The presence requirement for RRSIG signatures is relaxed for signing algorithms that appear only in the DNSKEY RRset (without appearing in the DS RRset or a trust anchor): RRSIGs for these algorithms are OPTIONAL.

This is because, as specified in (#dnskey), one of the DS algorithms is required to be an MTI algorithm, which validators are expected to support.
Presence of corresponding RRSIGs is thus sufficient to ensure that a valid path exists.


{#validator}
## Validator Requirements

This section updates RFC 4035 to clarify the required validation behavior.

### DS Validation and Processing

To establish the DNSSEC status of a given zone, a validating resolver (absent a local trust anchor) MUST validate the DS record set as a whole, by verifying the RRSIG signature provided by the parent for the DS record set or its proof of non-existence.
When that validation fails and no local trust anchor is available, the DS RRset is bad, and SERVFAIL MUST be returned.

If the DS record set is valid, the resolver evaluates for each DS record whether the algorithm of the associated key (as indicated by the DS record's algorithm field) and the hash digest algorithm (as indicated by the digest type field) are supported.
If either (or both) are not supported, the DS record is dropped from further consideration.
DS records that have a supported algorithm combination can be used for further validation ("supported DS records").

When the delegation does not contain any supported DS records (and a local trust anchor is not available), the child zone MUST be treated as "Insecure" (see [@!RFC4035] Section 5.2 and [@!RFC6840] Section 5.2).

### DNSKEY Validation and Processing

Otherwise, the resolver MUST check that the child zone's apex DNSKEY record set has at least one valid signature made with a key matching a supported DS record (or any local trust anchor).
If no such DNSKEY is found or if validation of the DNSKEY RRset fails, the entire child zone is "Bogus" for lack of a "Secure Entry Point" (SEP).
Queries to the entire child zone (and DNS subtree) MUST be answered with SERVFAIL (Section 5.5 of [@!RFC4035]).
The zone MUST NOT be treated as "Insecure".

Contrariwise, when the validation of the DNSKEY RRset succeeded, the entire set is authenticated.
Hence, all signing keys with an algorithm supported by the validating resolver may be used to validate RRsets of the zone, including those not directly referenced by or whose algorithm does not appear in the DS RRset (or trust anchor).


# Discussion

[[ This lacks accuracy / needs some more work ]]

Random thoughts:

It is possible to add algorithms at the DNSKEY that aren't in the DS RRset, but
not vice versa.

The new signing requirements allow multi-signer operation where the signers do
not all use the same algorithm, as long as all use MTI algorithms.

This faciliates glitch-free transfer of a signed zone from one provider to
another (without loss of resolution or validation).

## Validation when Multiple DS Records are Present

[[ TODO adapt for "any MTI and all others must work" ]]

It is perfectly fine for the set of supported DS records to pertain to keys of
different signing algorithms.
This situation is commonly encountered during algorithm rollover ([@?RFC6781]
Section 4.1.4).

For validation of the DNSKEY and any other RRset, one valid path along supported
DS record and eligible DNSKEY as outlined above is sufficient.
Validators SHOULD accept any single valid path.
They SHOULD NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the DS record set work,
and they MUST NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY record set
work ([@!RFC6840] Section 5.11).

More colloquially, validators MUST NOT apply a "logical AND" requirement on all
validation paths offered by the DS record set; instead, employing a "logical OR"
validation strategy is encouraged.

However, this does not mean that there is an expectation that any specific DS
record provides a working path: the DS RRset may reference several keys of the
same signing algorithm, with only one of them signing the DNSKEY RRset, and
others pointing "nowhere" (no corresponding DNSKEY).

This situation can routinely occur during a "Double-DS rollover" ([@?RFC6781]
Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3) or during multi-signer operation where several DNS
operators sign the same zone with separate keys ([@?RFC8901] Section 2.1.2).
Hence, the "logical OR" approach for finding a valid path.

Nevertheless, validators may make different choices of which algorithms are
supported, under the constraints of Section 3.1 of [@!RFC8624] (and successors)
where certain algorithms are listed as "mandatory-to-implement".

Note that if for whatever reason only one signing algorithm offered in the DS
RRset is supported, the validator can reasonably assume that algorithm to work.
This is due to the requirement on signers to include at least one corresponding
DNSKEY (and associated signatures) in the child zone for each signing algorithm
listed in the DS RRset.
If the zone is found to not provide a valid path with the supported algorithm,
the zone is thus "Bogus" for lack of a "Secure Entry Point" (see (#validator)),
even when keys and signatures of other (unsupported) algorithms appear to be
present.
In this case, the validator MUST NOT treat the zone as "insecure", but MUST
return SERVFAIL.

Similar considerations apply when multiple algorithms are supported, but all
options have been exhausted.

## Validation when Unexpected DNSSEC Records are Present

DS/DNSKEY records with unsupported algorithms MUST NOT affect validation.

Dangling RRSIGs (with unexpected algorithm numbers) MUST NOT affect validation.




The requirement for the signer to use any available MTI and all available non-MTI algorithms and the requirement for the validator to accept any supported validation path enable secure algorithm rollovers.
This implies that validation of a zone can happen whenever there is an intersection of the algorithm support of signer and validator.

If, in violation of the standard, a zone is not signed with all the required algorithms, it may fail validation at resolvers that only support the missing algorithms.

If, in violation of the standard, a validator insists on validating signatures for all algorithms, it may fail validation for zones that use unsupported algorithms.

If the standard was changed such that the signer is only required to sign with a single algorithm of its choice, then validators that do not support one of the algorithms used in the zone may not be able to validate the zone's RRsets.
This would result in either unavailability or degrated security of the zone.


[[TODO
Random thoughts on unexpected algorithms appearing in RRSIGs. Need to reword.

However, when "in DNSSEC mode" (i.e. there was a supported DS record, and the
DNSKEY RRset was valid), then the DNSKEY record set always contains the algorithm
of the supported DS record, and the signer MUST always have that algorithm present
for all other RRsets.
So, while the resolver SHOULD NOT enforce that all algorithms are always present:
When something seems weird and RRSIGs seem missing or have other (perhaps
unsupported) algorithms that were not present in the DS RRset, the resolver can
always take recourse with the argument that a zone or signer that does NOT
provide an RRSIG with the supported DS record's algorithm in such a case is in
violation of the RFC.
The situation is bogus because "the resolver believes there ought to be a chain
of trust".
This is a MUST, and not a contradiction to the fact that the resolver SHOULD NOT
enforce RRSIG presence for all algorithms.
In other words, even adding algorithms at the DNSKEY level is not "harmful", and
does not change the resolver's chain of trust expectations.
