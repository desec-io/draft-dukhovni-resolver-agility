   Clarifications on Signature Algorithm Presence in DNSSEC Zones and

Abstract

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] allows a zone to be signed with multiple signature
   algorithms.  When the DS record set for a zone securely indicates
   that the zone is signed using at least one algorithm supported by the
   validator, the validator MUST NOT treat this zone as "Insecure" (see
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]).  [RFC4035] and related documents arguably
   lack clarity on this palpable requirement.  This document attempts to
   fill the gap by giving guidance on how to avoid such downgrade
   attacks in resolver implementations [RFC4035].

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC (with core specifications [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035],
   [RFC6840]) employs a number of zone signing algorithms, some already
   obsolete, some mainstream and mandatory to implement, and others
   recommended to implement, but not yet widely deployed.  Validating
   resolvers generally support a range of algorithms beyond the
   mandatory to implement set: Some that are deprecated, but still in
   use by a non-trivial number of deployed zones, others that are
   expected to be in wider use in the future.  The status of the various
   algorithms is noted in Section 3 of [RFC8624], which is expected be
   updated in subsequent documents from time to time.

   Some zones may be signed with multiple algorithms.  Such multi-
   algorithm zones are typically in a transitional state from one
   algorithm to another, with at least the new algorithm expected to be
   widely deployed, allowing the older algorithm to be dropped at the
   end of the transition period.  (For the rollover procedure, see
   [RFC6781] Section 4.1.4.)

   Algorithms that a zone is signed with are signaled via the
   delegation's DS record set which is signed and published by the
   parent.  For each algorithm signaled this way, RRSIG signatures are
   expected to be present for each record in the zone (see Section 5.11
   of [RFC6840]).

   Therefore, for a multi-algorithm zone, a resolver is expected to
   treat all the mutually supported signature algorithms as equally
   valid, and to accept valid signatures made via any of the supported
   algorithms (see Section 5.4 of [RFC6840]).  This mechanism is not
   expected to ensure that the strongest of multiple shared algorithms
   is the only one used for validation; the sole requirement is
   resistance to downgrades of zones signed via a supported algorithm to
   "Insecure".

   A given validating resolver may not support one or more of the
   algorithms a zone is signed with.  When none are supported, absent
   local policy requiring the zone to be signed, the resolver MUST
   consider the zone "Insecure" (see Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]).  When,
   as explained in Section 2 below, the zone's signature algorithms
   overlap with those supported by the resolver, the zone MUST NOT be
   treated as "Insecure" (even when no RRSIGs for supported algorithms
   are included in a given reply).

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Validation Requirements

   The DS RRset of a zone may contain information on keys of several
   different algorithms; this is regularly the case in the context of
   algorithm rollover (Section 4.1.4 [RFC6781]).  The DS records
   relevant for validation of the DNSKEY RRset of a zone are Secure
   records with supported signature and digest algorithms and any such
   local trunst anchors.

   If no DS records are supported (including the case when there are no
   DS records), the zone MUST be treated as Insecure (Section 5.2 of
   [RFC4035]; Section 5.2 of [RFC6840]).  If DS records are supported,
   the zone SHOULD NOT be treated as Insecure (Section 5 of [RFC4035]).
   The zone's candidate signing keys are those from the DNSKEY RRset
   that match(*) any supported DS record and have protocol 3 and have
   the "Zone Key" flag bit set.  Note that the "Secure Entry Point" bit
   is informational only and MUST be ignored by validators
   (Section 2.1.1 of [RFC4043]).

   If validation of the DNSKEY RRset fails, queries to the entire zone
   (and DNS subtree) MUST be answered with SERVFAIL (Section 5.5 of
   [RFC4035]).  If validation succeeds, all supported keys in the DNSKEY
   RRset with protocol 3 and "Zone Key" flag bit set may be used to
   validate records of the zone.

   [[ (*) Define/refer to definition of "matches"? ]]

   For validation of the DNSKEY and any other RRset, one validation path
   against the keys outlined above is sufficient to validate.  In more
   detail, validators SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They SHOULD
   NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and
   they MUST NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset
   work.  (Section 5.11 of [RFC6840])

2.2.  Signer Requirements

   The zone signer MUST ensure that each record in the zone has a
   signature made with each algorithm associated with some candidate
   zone signing key (Section 5.11 of [RFC6840]).  It is possible to add
   algorithms at the DNSKEY that aren't in the DS record, but not vice
   versa.

3.  Discussion

   The requirement for the signer to use all available algorithms and
   the requirement for the validator to accept any supported validation
   path enable secure algorithm rollovers.  This implies that validation
   of a zone can happen whenever there is an intersection of the
   algorithm support of signer and validator.

   If, in violation of the standard, a zone is not signed with all the
   required algorithms, it may fail validation at resolvers that only
   support the missing algorithms.

   If, in violation of the standard, a validator insists on validating
   signatures for all algorithms, it may fail validation for zones that
   use unsupported algorithms.

   If the standard was changed such that the signer is only required to
   sign with a single algorithm of its choice, then validators that do
   not support one of the algorithms used in the zone may not be able to
   validate the zone's RRsets.  This would result in either
   unavailability or degrated security of the zone.
