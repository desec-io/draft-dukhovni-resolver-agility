   Clarifications on Signature Algorithm Presence in DNSSEC Zones and

Abstract

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] allows a zone to be signed with multiple signature
   algorithms.  When the DS record set for a zone securely indicates
   that the zone is signed using at least one algorithm supported by the
   validator, the validator MUST NOT treat this zone as "Insecure" (see
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]).  Not following this strategy would
   effectively condone unvalidated answers against better knowledge,
   rendering DNSSEC ineffective.  [RFC4035] and related documents
   arguably lack clarity on this palpable requirement.  This document
   attempts to fill the gap by giving guidance on how to avoid such
   downgrade attacks in resolver implementations.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC (with core specifications [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035],
   [RFC6840]) employs a number of zone signing algorithms, some already
   obsolete, some mainstream and mandatory to implement, and others
   recommended to implement, but not yet widely deployed.  Validating
   resolvers generally support a range of algorithms beyond the
   mandatory-to-implement set: Some that are deprecated, but still
   deployed by a non-negligible number of live zones, and others that
   are expected to be in wider use in the future.  The status of the
   various algorithms is noted in Section 3 of [RFC8624], which is
   expected be updated in subsequent documents from time to time.

   Some zones may be signed with multiple algorithms.  Such multi-
   algorithm zones are typically in a transitional state from one
   algorithm to another, with at least the new algorithm expected to be
   (or become) widely deployed, allowing the older algorithm to be
   dropped at the end of the transition period.  (For the rollover
   procedure, see [RFC6781] Section 4.1.4.)

   Algorithms that a zone is signed with are signaled via the
   delegation's DS record set which is signed and published by the
   parent.  For each algorithm signaled this way, RRSIG signatures are
   expected to be present for each record in the zone (see Section 5.11
   of [RFC6840]).

   Therefore, for a multi-algorithm zone, a resolver is expected to
   treat all the mutually supported signature algorithms as equally
   valid, and to accept valid signatures made via any of the supported
   algorithms (see Section 5.4 of [RFC6840]).  This mechanism is not
   expected to ensure that the strongest of multiple shared algorithms
   is the only one used for validation; the sole requirement is
   resistance to downgrades to "Insecure" for zones signed via a
   supported algorithm.

   A given validating resolver may not support one or more of the
   algorithms a zone is signed with.  When none are supported, absent
   local policy requiring the zone to be signed, the resolver MUST
   consider the zone "Insecure" (see Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]).  But
   whenever the zone's signature algorithms overlap with those supported
   by the resolver, the zone MUST NOT be treated as "Insecure"; this
   holds even when no RRSIGs for supported algorithms are included in a
   given reply.  Section 2 below explains these requirements in greater
   detail.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Requirements on Signature Algorithms Present in DNSSEC Zones and
    Answers

   To include a child domain in the parent's DNSSEC chain of trust, the
   parent provides a cryptographic link to the child.  The parent does
   this by computing cryptographic hashes of the DNSSEC keys that the
   child wishes to be included in the delegation.  As various hash
   digest algorithms are available, the chosen algorithm is recorded
   alongside each fingerprint.  This information, together with the
   key's signing algorithm (and some derived "keytag" metadata), is
   included in the parent zone in the form of "Delegation Signer" (DS)
   records, alongside the delegation's NS (and glue) records.

   Due to the degree of freedom in choosing the hash algorithm, the
   parent may publish several DS records for each key (one per hash
   algorithm).  Typically, one or two DS records are published for a
   given key ([RFC8624] Section 3.3).

   A domain's delegation thus has at least one DS record for each child
   DNSSEC key that the child has designated to be included in the
   delegation.  The DS record's hash digest algorithm and the associated
   key's signing algorithm can easily be seen by inspection of the DS
   record data.

   Note that the hash digest algorithm used for DS record preparation is
   not to be confused with the signing algorithm of the DNSSEC key
   associated with that DS record.

2.1.  Validation Requirements

   To establish the DNSSEC status of a given zone, a validating resolver
   (absent a local trust anchor) MUST validate the DS record set as a
   whole, by verifying the RRSIG signature provided by the parent for
   the DS record set or its proof of non-existence.  When that
   validation fails and no local trust anchor is available, the DS
   record set is bad, and SERVFAIL MUST be returned.  [TODO source]

   If the DS record set is valid, the resolver evaluates for each DS
   record whether the algorithm of the associated key (as indicated by
   the DS record's algorithm field) and the hash digest algorithm (as
   indicated by the digest type field) are supported.  If either (or
   both) are not supported, the DS record is dropped from further
   consideration.  DS records that have a supported algorithm
   combination can be used for further validation ("supported DS
   records").

   When the delegation does not contain any supported DS records (and a
   local trust anchor is not available), the child zone MUST be treated
   as "Insecure" (see [RFC4035] Section 5.2 and [RFC6840] Section 5.2).

   Otherwise, the resolver MUST check that the child zone's apex DNSKEY
   record set has at least one valid signature made with a key matching
   a supported DS record (or any local trust anchor).  If no such DNSKEY
   is found, the entire child zone is "Bogus" for lack of a "Secure
   Entry Point" (SEP).  The zone SHOULD NOT be treated as "Insecure"
   ([RFC4035] Section 5).  [TODO]

   The zone's candidate signing keys are those zone apex DNSKEYs with
   the protocol field set to 3 ([RFC4034] Section 2.1.2) and the "Zone
   Key" flag bit set ([RFC4034] Section 2.1.1).  Keys that do not
   fulfill these conditions are not signing keys and cannot be used for
   validation.  (Note that the "Secure Entry Point" bit is informational
   only and not examined during validation, see [RFC4043]
   Section 2.1.1.)

   If validation of the DNSKEY RRset fails, queries to the entire child
   zone (and DNS subtree) MUST be answered with SERVFAIL (Section 5.5 of
   [RFC4035]).  Contrariwise, when the validation of the DNSKEY RRset
   succeeded, all signing keys with an algorithm supported by the
   validating resolver may be used to validate records of the zone.

   It is perfectly fine for the set of supported DS records to pertain
   to keys of different signing algorithms.  This situation is commonly
   encountered during algorithm rollover ([RFC6781] Section 4.1.4).

   For validation of the DNSKEY and any other RRset, one valid path
   along supported DS record and eligible DNSKEY as outlined above is
   sufficient.  Validators SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They
   SHOULD NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the DS record set
   work, and they MUST NOT insist that all algorithms signaled in the
   DNSKEY record set work ([RFC6840] Section 5.11).

2.2.  Signer Requirements

   The zone signer MUST ensure that each record in the zone has a
   signature made with each algorithm associated with some candidate
   zone signing key (Section 5.11 of [RFC6840]).

   It is possible to add algorithms at the DNSKEY that aren't in the DS
   record, but not vice versa.

3.  Discussion

   [[ This lacks accuracy / needs some more work ]]

   The requirement for the signer to use all available algorithms and
   the requirement for the validator to accept any supported validation
   path enable secure algorithm rollovers.  This implies that validation
   of a zone can happen whenever there is an intersection of the
   algorithm support of signer and validator.

   If, in violation of the standard, a zone is not signed with all the
   required algorithms, it may fail validation at resolvers that only
   support the missing algorithms.

   If, in violation of the standard, a validator insists on validating
   signatures for all algorithms, it may fail validation for zones that
   use unsupported algorithms.

   If the standard was changed such that the signer is only required to
   sign with a single algorithm of its choice, then validators that do
   not support one of the algorithms used in the zone may not be able to
   validate the zone's RRsets.  This would result in either
   unavailability or degrated security of the zone.

   [[TODO Random thoughts on unexpected algorithms appearing in RRSIGs.
   Need to reword.

   |  It is possible to add algorithms at the DNSKEY that aren't in the
   |  DS record, but not vice versa.

   However, when "in DNSSEC mode" (i.e. there was a supported DS record,
   and the DNSKEY RRset was valid), then the DNSKEY record set always
   contains the algorithm of the supported DS record, and the signer
   MUST always have that algorithm present for all other RRsets.  So,
   while the resolver SHOULD NOT enforce that all algorithms are always
   present: When something seems weird and RRSIGs seem missing or have
   other (perhaps unsupported) algorithms that were not present in the
   DS RRset, the resolver can always take recourse with the argument
   that a zone or signer that does NOT provide an RRSIG with the
   supported DS record's algorithm in such a case is in violation of the
   RFC.  The situation is bogus because "the resolver believes there
   ought to be a chain of trust".  This is a MUST, and not a
   contradiction to the fact that the resolver SHOULD NOT enforce RRSIG
   presence for all algorithms.  In other words, even adding algorithms
   at the DNSKEY level is not "harmful", and does not change the
   resolver's chain of trust expectations. ]]
