   Clarifications on Signature Algorithm Presence in DNSSEC Zones and
                                Answers

Abstract

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] allows RRsets to be accompanied with multiple
   RRSIGs, generated using different keys and even different signature
   algorithms.  This document is concerned with clarifications around
   the validation of RRsets, in particular in presence of DS and/or
   DNSKEY records defining more than one DNSSEC signature algorithm.

   When a zone is signed with an algorithm that is also supported by a
   given validating resolver, the resolver's validation strategy MUST
   NOT allow this fact to be overlooked, as the resolver could otherwise
   be convinced to regard the zone as "Insecure" instead of "Secure" and
   consequently accept unvalidated answers (see Section 4.3 of
   [RFC4035]), rendering DNSSEC fully ineffective.  [RFC4035] and
   related documents arguably lack clarity on this palpable requirement.

   This document attempts to fill the gap by giving guidance on how to
   avoid such downgrade attacks in resolver implementations [RFC4035].

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC (with core specifications [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035],
   [RFC6840]) employs a number of zone signing algorithms, some already
   obsolete, some mainstream and mandatory to implement, and others
   recommended to implement, but not yet widely deployed.  Validating
   resolvers generally support a range of algorithms beyond the
   mandatory to implement set: Some that are deprecated, but still in
   use by a non-trivial number of deployed zones, others that are
   expected to be in wider use in the future.  The status of the various
   algorithms is noted in Section 3 of [RFC8624], which is expected be
   updated in subsequent documents from time to time.

   Some zones may be signed with multiple algorithms.  Such multi-
   algorithm zones are typically in a transitional state from one
   algorithm to another, with at least the new algorithm expected to be
   widely deployed, allowing the older algorithm to be dropped at the
   end of the transition period.  (For the rollover procedure, see
   [RFC6781] Section 4.1.4.)

   Algorithms that a zone is signed with are signaled via the
   delegation's DS record set which is signed and published by the
   parent.  For each algorithm signaled this way, RRSIG signatures are
   expected to be present for each record in the zone (see Section 5.11
   of [RFC6840]).

   Therefore, for a multi-algorithm zone, a resolver is expected to
   treat all the mutually supported signature algorithms as equally
   valid, and to accept valid signatures made via any of the supported
   algorithms (see Section 5.4 of [RFC6840]).  This mechanism is not
   expected to ensure that the strongest of multiple shared algorithms
   is the only one used for validation; the sole requirement is
   resistance to downgrades of zones signed via a supported algorithm to
   "Insecure".

   A given validating resolver may not support one or more of the
   algorithms a zone is signed with.  When none are supported, absent
   local policy requiring the zone to be signed, the resolver MUST
   consider the zone "Insecure" (see Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]).  When,
   as explained in Section 2 below, the zone's signature algorithms
   overlap with those supported by the resolver, the zone MUST NOT be
   treated as "Insecure" (even when no RRSIGs for supported algorithms
   are included in a given reply).

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Requirements on Signature Algorithms Present in DNSSEC Zones and
    Answers

   [[ Explain algorithm agility for DS records and that if a supported
   combination of signature and hash algorithms is found there, the
   resolver MUST check that the zone apex DNSKEY RRset has at least one
   valid signature made with a key (SEP) matching a supported DS record
   (or any local trust anchor), otherwise the entire zone is "Bogus" for
   lack of a "Secure Entry Point" (SEP).

   The zone's candidate signing keys are then those zone apex DNSKEYs
   with protocol 3 (see Section 2.1.2 of [RFC4034])) and the "Zone Key"
   flag bit set (see Section 2.1.1 of [RFC4034]).  The zone signer MUST
   ensure that each record in the zone has a signature made with each
   algorithm associated with some candidate zone signing key.

   The requirements on the validating resolver are somewhat less strict,
   if the zone is not "Insecure", for lack of a supported DS record in
   the parent zone (or a alternatively a local trust anchor), then the
   resolver MUST only require that at least one supported validatable
   RRSIG sign each RRset for which the zone is authoritative (i.e.
   everything other than delegation NS and glue address records).

   This means that a resolver SHOULD accept a response signed with only
   a subset of the required signature algorithms, so long at least one
   of these signatures is supported and valid (passes signature
   validation, is not expired and made by a candidate key).

   If a zone is not signed with all the required algorithms, it may
   appear "Bogus" to resolvers that only support the missing algorithms,
   so all the required signatures MUST be present, but resolvers SHOULD
   NOT enforce this.  ... ]]
