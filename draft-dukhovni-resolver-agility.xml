<abstract>
<t>DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4035"></xref> allows a zone to be signed with multiple signature
algorithms.
When the DS record set for a zone securely indicates that the zone is
signed using at least one algorithm supported by the validator, the validator
MUST NOT treat this zone as &quot;Insecure&quot; (see Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC4035"></xref>).
<xref target="RFC4035"></xref> and related documents arguably lack clarity on this palpable
requirement.
This document attempts to fill the gap by giving guidance on how to avoid such
downgrade attacks in resolver implementations <xref target="RFC4035"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>DNSSEC (with core specifications <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4034"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4035"></xref>,
<xref target="RFC6840"></xref>) employs a number of zone signing algorithms, some already obsolete,
some mainstream and mandatory to implement, and others recommended to implement,
but not yet widely deployed.
Validating resolvers generally support a range of algorithms beyond the
mandatory to implement set: Some that are deprecated, but still in use by a
non-trivial number of deployed zones, others that are expected to be in wider
use in the future.
The status of the various algorithms is noted in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8624"></xref>, which
is expected be updated in subsequent documents from time to time.</t>
<t>Some zones may be signed with multiple algorithms.  Such multi-algorithm zones
are typically in a transitional state from one algorithm to another, with at
least the new algorithm expected to be widely deployed, allowing the older
algorithm to be dropped at the end of the transition period.
(For the rollover procedure, see <xref target="RFC6781"></xref> Section 4.1.4.)</t>
<t>Algorithms that a zone is signed with are signaled via the delegation's DS
record set which is signed and published by the parent.
For each algorithm signaled this way, RRSIG signatures are expected to be
present for each record in the zone (see Section 5.11 of <xref target="RFC6840"></xref>).</t>
<t>Therefore, for a multi-algorithm zone, a resolver is expected to treat all the
mutually supported signature algorithms as equally valid, and to accept valid
signatures made via any of the supported algorithms (see Section 5.4 of
<xref target="RFC6840"></xref>).
This mechanism is not expected to ensure that the strongest of multiple shared
algorithms is the only one used for validation; the sole requirement is
resistance to downgrades of zones signed via a supported algorithm to
&quot;Insecure&quot;.</t>
<t>A given validating resolver may not support one or more of the algorithms a zone
is signed with.
When none are supported, absent local policy requiring the zone to be signed,
the resolver MUST consider the zone &quot;Insecure&quot; (see Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC4035"></xref>).
When, as explained in <xref target="requirements"></xref> below, the zone's signature algorithms
overlap with those supported by the resolver, the zone MUST NOT be treated as
&quot;Insecure&quot; (even when no RRSIGs for supported algorithms are included in a given
reply).</t>

<t>RFC 4035 Sec. 4.3: Definitions for Secure, Insecure, Bogus, Indeterminate
Secure: has chain of trust
Insecure: RRset lies in unsigned zone or decendant of unsigned zone
Bogus: resolver believes there ought to be a chain of trust</t>

<section anchor="signer-requirements"><name>Signer Requirements</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>RFC 4035 Sec. 2.2: The apex DNSKEY RRset
itself MUST be signed by each algorithm appearing in the DS RRset
located at the delegating parent (if any).</li>
<li>RFC 6840 Sec. 5.11: The presence of an algorithm in either a
  zone's DS or DNSKEY RRset signals that that algorithm is used to
  sign the entire zone.
  ...
  It is possible to add algorithms at
  the DNSKEY that aren't in the DS record, but not vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="validator-requirements"><name>Validator Requirements</name>

<ul>
<li><t>RFC 4035 Sec. 5: Validator uses local configuration or relevant (Secure) DS records to determine if it &quot;SHOULD believe that a zone is signed&quot;. I.e., if configuration or DS record is present, Insecure status is ruled out. In contrast, RFC 4035 Sec. 4.3 (Definition Insecure) makes explicit that Insecure RRsets may or may not be signed, so that the presence of signature cannot be used to determine the zone's security status.</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 4035 Sec. 5.5: Mandate to SERVFAIL if none of the RRSIGs can be validated</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 4035 Sec. 5.2: Mandate to Insecure if no DS algo is supported</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 4035 Sec. 5: resolver SHOULD believe that a zone is signed if the
resolver has been configured with public key information for the
zone, or if the zone's parent is signed and the delegation from the
parent contains a DS RRset.</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 6840 Sec. 5.11: Validators
SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They SHOULD NOT insist that all
algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and they MUST NOT insist
that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset work.</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 6840 Sec. 5.2: In brief, DS records
using unknown or unsupported message digest algorithms MUST be
treated the same way as DS records referring to DNSKEY RRs of unknown
or unsupported public key algorithms.</t>
</li>
<li><t>RFC 6840 Sec. 5.2:
In other words, when determining the security status of a zone, a
validator disregards any authenticated DS records that specify
unknown or unsupported DNSKEY algorithms.  If none are left, the zone
is treated as if it were unsigned.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>[[ Explain algorithm agility for DS records and that if a supported combination
   of signature and hash algorithms is found there, the resolver MUST check that
   the zone apex DNSKEY RRset has at least one valid signature made with a key
   (SEP) matching a supported DS record (or any local trust anchor), otherwise the
   entire zone is &quot;Bogus&quot; for lack of a &quot;Secure Entry Point&quot; (SEP).</t>
<t>The zone's candidate signing keys are then those zone apex DNSKEYs with
   protocol 3 (see Section 2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4034"></xref>)) and the &quot;Zone Key&quot; flag bit
   set (see Section 2.1.1 of <xref target="RFC4034"></xref>).  The zone signer MUST ensure that
   each record in the zone has a signature made with each algorithm associated
   with some candidate zone signing key.</t>
<t>The requirements on the validating resolver are somewhat less strict, if the
   zone is not &quot;Insecure&quot;, for lack of a supported DS record in the parent zone
   (or a alternatively a local trust anchor), then the resolver MUST only require
   that at least one supported validatable RRSIG sign each RRset for which the zone
   is authoritative (i.e. everything other than delegation NS and glue address
   records).</t>
<t>This means that a resolver SHOULD accept a response signed with only a subset
   of the required signature algorithms, so long at least one of these signatures
   is supported and valid (passes signature validation, is not expired and made by
   a candidate key).</t>
<t>If a zone is not signed with all the required algorithms, it may appear &quot;Bogus&quot;
   to resolvers that only support the missing algorithms, so all the required
   signatures MUST be present, but resolvers SHOULD NOT enforce this.
